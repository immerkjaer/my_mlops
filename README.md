my_mlops
==============================

- Pytorch lightning has been used (see src/models/model.py and src/models/mnist_data_loader.py)
- Very simple test using pytest
- wandb and dvc has been set up
- flake8 and isort has been tested
- requirements has been fixed to eliminate transitive dependencies
- the Makefile has been updated to push deploy locally, deploy in cluster hosted by google
- a deploy folder has been created with a .yaml for kubernetes deployment
